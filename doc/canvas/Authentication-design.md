# Authentication design

This document describes the design artefacts for the Authentication part of the [overall ODA Canvas design](/Canvas-design.md).

## Use cases

The authentication use cases are documented in the [use case library](../usecase-library/README.md) as follows:

* [UC001-Bootstrap-role-for-component](/usecase-library/UC001-Bootstrap-role-for-component.md)
* [UC002-Expose-APIs-for-Component](/usecase-library/UC002-Expose-APIs-for-Component.md)
* [UC003-Discover-dependent-APIs-for-Component](/usecase-library/UC003-Discover-dependent-APIs-for-Component.md)
* [UC007-Authentication-external](/usecase-library/UC007-Authentication-external.md)
* [UC008-Authentication-internal](/usecase-library/UC008-Authentication-internal.md)

## BDD Features

For each use case, a set of BDD features describes the behaviour required of the Canvas, using scenarios. The goal is for a set of business-friendly pseudo-code that describes the behaviour of the Canvas, and that directly maps to tests that will test that feature. Some features are option - the test report will indicate which features have passed, but will not fail the test for a canvas if an optional feature is not implemented.
