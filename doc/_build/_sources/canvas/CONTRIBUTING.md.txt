# How to contribute to the ODA Canvas Accelerator

## Have you read our code of conduct?

We want the ODA Canvas Accelerator to be a welcoming community project. We have a [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.md) that we expect all participants to follow in all interactions with, or about, the project. We will take corrective action where the code of conduct is not followed.

## Can you contribute under the terms of the license?

The project is released under the Apache 2 license. Please ensure that you have all necessary permissions to contribute code under those terms.

## Is something not working as expected?

- If it's a security vulnerability, please contact us directly at [components@tmforum.org](mailto:components@tmforum.org)rather than creating an issue. We will work together to figure out when and how that vulnerability will be disclosed.
- Check the issues to see if what you're experiencing has already been reported.
- If needed, open a new issue, and give us as much information as you can about what you did, what you were expecting and what actually happened. Even better, if you know what the root of the problem is, tell us that too.

## Can you fix a bug?

- Fork the repo, make your changes and then open a pull request against our repo with the fix.
- Make sure the PR clearly describes the problem and the solution. If you have already raised an issue, please include that reference as well.

## Do you need a new feature?

Raise an issue describing the feature you need and how you might implement it before starting to code. Any feature that is applied to the codebase will eventually become part of the TM Forum Open Digital Architecture standard, so new features may need ratifying before implementation. We can have that discussion with you as part of the issue and nail the feature down in a way that will be acceptable to members before development work starts.
