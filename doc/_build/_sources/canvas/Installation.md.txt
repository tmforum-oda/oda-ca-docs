# Installation

## Step 1: Installing cluster enablers

The only enabler at the moment is the canvas ```namespace```.  Install it using:

```
helm install oda-ri-enablers clusterenablers/ 
```

## Step 2: Installing Reference Implementation services
Install cert-manager to handle certificate creation and signing for the webhook using:
```
pushd ReferenceImplementation/cert-manager
bash install_cert-manager.sh
popd
```
## Step 3: Installing the Canvas
There is an example script (```install_canvas_cert-manager.sh```) that will install the Canvas using the chart locally. It does the following:
- Configure the correct Helm repositories
- Create certificates for the oda.tmforum.org CRD webhook using cert-manager
- Update the dependencies in subcharts (currently just for Keycloak)
- Install the canvas itself (CRDs, namespaces, component controller)
- Install the canvas-specific components in the canvas namespace

Install it using:
```
bash install_canvas_cert-manager.sh
```

## Step 4: Configuring Keycloak

Finally, you will also need to configure Keycloak as follows:
- Log in to the admin console. Unless you changed it manually, the default credentials we've set are in the [Keycloak values.yaml file](https://github.com/tmforum-oda/oda-canvas-charts/blob/master/canvas/charts/keycloak/values.yaml)
- [Create a new realm](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_create-realm) called ```myrealm```
- [Create a user in myrealm](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_create-new-user) called ```seccon```
### Notes
- It is possible to enable or disable creation of namespaces in the ```values.yaml``` file.
- Names of namespaces are set to ```canvas``` and ```components``` unless overridden.

## Step 5 (only if using Istio Service Mesh)

If you are deploying on Istio Service Mesh, you have to enable Istio injection in the namespaces where the canvas and components will be deployed. This can be done by running the following commands:


```bash
kubectl label namespace canvas istio-injection=enabled
kubectl label namespace components istio-injection=enabled
```
