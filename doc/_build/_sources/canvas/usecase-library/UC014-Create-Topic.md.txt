# Create Topic use-case

This use-case describes what happens when a topic is created on the Event Management component.

* When a new topic is created the component will create two new roles: topicName.publisher & topicName.Subscriber
* An Operator should raise the privileges for components so that they can publish Events
* An Operator should raise the privileges for components for them to receive Events
* The enableEventPublishing Operator should react on Topic creation (and privilege changes?)
* The enableEventSubscription Operator should react on Topic creation (and privilege changes?)

## Create Topic

## Allow publishing for a component

## Allow subscribing for a component
