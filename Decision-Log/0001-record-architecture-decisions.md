# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2023-04-06

## Status

Approved by ODA-CA board meeting on 2023-04-27

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project, allow all project members to contribute to decisions and provide transparency of decisions made. Once a decision is approved, all contributions should align to that decision. It is possible to change or reverse decisions - in this case, a new decision is created, and once approved the previous decision is marked as superseded. 

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

This decision 0001 is an example of an Architecture Decision Record and it also demonstrates the template we will use for future decisions.

The status can be one of:

| Status                           | Description                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| In progress                      | The decision is being worked on to provide a recommendation to the ODA-CA working group board             | 
| Pending ODA-CA board approval    | The decision documents a recommendation that will be discussed in the ODA-CA working group board          |
| Approved by ODA-CA board         | The decision is approved. All contributions should align to this decision                                 |
| Superseded                       | If a later decision changes or reverses a decision, we mark as superseded (and refer to new decision)     |
