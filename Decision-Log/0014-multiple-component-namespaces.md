# 14. Supporting Multiple Component Namespaces

Date: 2025-05-20

## Status

Pending

## Context

Operations teams often need to organize components across different Kubernetes namespaces for security isolation, resource management, and organizational purposes. Currently, there's a need to clarify whether components should be restricted to a single namespace or if they can span multiple namespaces within a cluster. Additionally, there's a question about whether multiple canvas implementations should coexist in different namespaces within the same cluster.

## Decision

1. We will support components being deployed across multiple namespaces within a Kubernetes cluster.

2. We will NOT support multiple canvas implementations in different namespaces within the same cluster.

## Consequences

### Supporting Multiple Component Namespaces

- **Benefits**:
  - Greater flexibility for operations teams to organize components
  - Better security isolation between different components
  - Improved resource management and quota allocation on a per-namespace basis
  - Allows for fine-grained access control to different sets of components

- **Challenges**:
  - Cross-namespace communication must be properly configured
  - Canvas operators will need to monitor multiple namespaces

### Not Supporting Multiple Canvas Namespaces

- **Rationale**:
  - The complexity of managing multiple canvas implementations in a single cluster is deemed too high
  - Potential for resource conflicts and confusion in management
  - Difficult to ensure proper isolation between canvas instances
  
- **Recommendation**:
  - Organizations requiring multiple canvas implementations should deploy them in separate Kubernetes clusters
  - This provides cleaner separation and avoids potential conflicts or complexity
