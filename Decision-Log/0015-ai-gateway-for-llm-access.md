# 15. AI Model Gateway for LLM Access

Date: 2025-10-06

## Status

Approved in 2025 Innovation Hub Elevate Workshop

## Context

As software agents increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning, decision-making, and interaction, it becomes critical to ensure that their use aligns with enterprise policies, ethical standards, and regulatory requirements. Uncontrolled access to LLMs can lead to:

• Lack of auditability
• Exposure to security and compliance risks  
• Difficulty enforcing AI guardrails

## Decision

All software agents requiring access to LLMs must do so through an AI Gateway. The AI Gateway will serve as a Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) and provide:

• Authentication and authorization of agents
• Policy enforcement for prompt filtering, rate limiting, and model selection
• Audit logging of all interactions with LLMs
• Guardrail enforcement, including safety checks and usage boundaries

The AI Gateway may integrate with existing identity platforms and observability stacks, and support multiple LLM providers (e.g., Google, Azure, Anthropic, Llama).

## Consequences

• All agent-based components must route LLM interactions through the AI Model Gateway.
• Canvas and reference implementations must include AI Model Gateway integration examples.
• Governance and compliance teams gain visibility into AI usage.
• Introduces potential latency in LLM interactions due to policy enforcement and routing overhead. Performance monitoring and optimization strategies should be considered in implementation.
• Future decisions may define specific guardrail policies and auditing schemas.
