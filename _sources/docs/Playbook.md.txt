# Introduction to the ODA Component Accelerator Project (ODA-CA)

**The Open Digital Architecture**

ODA is an enterprise architecture blueprint for modular, cloud native open digital platforms that can be orchestrated using AI.  It is being developed and maintained by members of [TM Forum](https://www.tmforum.org/).  You can start learning about ODA [here](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/).

[ODA Components](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/implementation/technical-architecture-components/) are part of the *Implementation* quadrant of the ODA. They are  standardized, reusable, microservices-based software building blocks of ODA, connected via [Open APIs](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/implementation/open-apis/). ODA Components are deployed onto an [ODA Canvas](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/deployment-runtime/oda-canvas/), which is in the *Deployment & Runtime* quadrant of the ODA. The Canvas provides a standardized execution platform aligning to Site Reliability Engineering practices.

**Check if your company is already involved in developing ODA**

If your company is a TM Forum member (check [here](https://www.tmforum.org/membership/current-members/)), you can join the ODA collaboration projects [here](https://myaccount.tmforum.org/joinproject) to contribute to ODA and influence its development.

If your company has signed the [ODA manifesto](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/open-digital-architecture-open-api-manifesto/), then it is already committed to ODA's design principles and essential standards to enable a truly ‘plug and play’ set of technology capabilities.

**The ODA-CA project**
 
The ODA Component Accelerator (ODA-CA) is a practical project run by TM Forum member companies in our Open Digital Lab environment. The aims are:

* Collaborative development of the ODA Canvas and ODA Reference Implementation(s) in order to validate ODA in real world applications
* Building a test environment and tooling to validate vendors' commercial products for conformance to the ODA Component specifications
* Developing best practices for deployment of ODA Components and the ODA Canvas 
* Accelerating the ODA standards by contributing practical implementation experience back into the standardization process

Since the project [started in December 2020](https://www.tmforum.org/press-and-news/leading-telecoms-companies-collaborating-to-build-market-for-plug-and-play-software/) we have:

* Built a reference ODA Canvas in our Open Digital Lab based on Kubernetes infrastructure
* Delivered a prototype Component CTK which validates security and functional aspects of ODA Components using a 3-stage test platform in the Open Digital Lab
* Deployed a number of commercial applications onto the reference Canvas and validated them with the prototype Component CTK
* Demonstrated deployment patterns for security and observability use cases
* Built a ‘click-to-deploy’ reference Canvas for TM Forum members to use
